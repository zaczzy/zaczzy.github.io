#### Why my graduate GPA is only <sub><sup>3.2</sup></sub> when I was <sub><sup>magna cum laude</sup></sub> as an undergrad?
<sub><sup>This is really a false argument, I didn't do well, or as well as I hoped to do, as an undergrad. I wished to be a machine learning engineer. That didn't work out.
I had many disillusioning moments in college. Life can be a paradox. I realized that my preconceived career in machine learning aren’t the best for me. I found my interest in linux through painstakingly installing systems at my first job. 
I had to face my lack of personal drive, reconcile my relationship with my family far far away, and accept my hard-earned victories are indeed mine. Fight the imposter’s syndrome. I deserve to be among these amazing people, for I can do amazing work too.
But the most severe challenging was then. March 2020, first month of Covid-19, I felt, almost for no reason, depressed. I had severe hyperthyroidism back then and I didn’t seek treatment. My hands were shaking horribly, I lost around 26 pounds in a month. Went from the peak of my weight to the all-time low since high school.
Like MJ, Winnie Harlow, I had vitiligo. It was the onset stage and my skin was losing pigments. I had disillusioning moments, I’m not good at Security games and Cryptography. I never felt a stronger lack of drive everyday. At the end of semester, I had a D in Security. 
If you don’t have a drive to live, you don’t mind death. But I don’t think that’s how I really felt. I tried religion, made new friends who are also reaching out to divinity for curing their real depression. I was certain then I’m not really depressed. I tried therapy, talking to a listening, caring person helped. 
My girlfriend moved in with me. Slowly but surely, I have finally gotten over the worse period of my young adult life. 
I got treated for hyperthyroidism in May 2021, after I regained confidence. Confidence that was rebuilt slowly by having a job I’m passionate about, exercise, losing weight and having hope. I was a coincidence that they discovered my hyperthyroidism, I was treated for a lump under my skin. 
Turns out, overactive thyroid leads to depression and short-tempers. Maybe I wasn’t who I thought I was. Ha, who knew! 
All of this inflictions are caused by my immune system, which is going bananas in my body, attacking my skin and glands.  But with treatments, exercise and a hopeful attitude, I don’t think anything can stop me. Everyone has their struggles, I believe. Mine is nothing special. But I believe that mine lead to my personal growth.
So yeah, that's why my graduate GPA is what it is. I don't know what this story is trying to tell.</sup></sub>
