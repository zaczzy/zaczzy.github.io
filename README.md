## My undergradate major: what is NETS?
Networked and social systems engineering, or NETS, is a UPenn special program aimed to help students with interdisciplinary interests in Computer Science, Systems engineering and Economics. It allowed students to pursue a traditional CS major, specialize in network science, data science, systems engineering, economics, communications or anything in-between.

**A solid CS traditional training**

In my case, I had a traditional CS experience, but also utilized the additional freedom of the curriculum to prioritize certain CS courses over others.

Specifically, I have taken all courses required for the CS undergrad, except the following two:
1. CIS 262 Automata, Computability, and Complexity (I have taken a more advanced version of this course: CIS 511, as a graduate)
2. CIS 471	Computer Organization and Design (The "hardware" course in our CS department. Unfortunately our professor has been on sabbatical so I couldn't take this course during my stay at UPenn.)

But I have taken many more CS courses than required. Also, I have always optted for the more challenging version of the same course. (e.g. CIS 520 over CIS 519 on machine learning, MATH 314 advanced linear algebra over MATH 312 the normal version.)
By taking the hardest challenges head-on, I can proudly declare that my undergraduate education is much more transformative and fullfilling than a traditional CS major.

**Something a little more**

Any CS faculty @Penn holds the NETS student at the same technical proficiency requirement as the CS (named CIS @ UPenn) student. In fact, the transfer process between the two majors is as easy as submitting a form in Sophomore year. But the NETS faculty imposes additional expectation for young NETS scholars. These tailored NETS courses are so useful that CS students often consider it a requirement as well:
1. [NETS 212](https://nets212.seas.upenn.edu/): scalable and cloud computing. The ONLY undergrad level course that introduces real cloud computing concepts.
2. NETS 312: theory of networks. This is the de-facto network science course.
3. [NETS 412](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/courses/agtS17.html): algorithmic game theory. Well, it's advanced game theory that focuses on welfare, pricing and games from a network of actors. It's more difficult than all of my data stuctures and algorithm courses combined. It's exceptionally well taught by our young and brilliant Prof. Aaron Roth. Enough said. 

**Summary**

For any potential employer, you can view my transcipt to see that my education is more technical than the average CS major. At times, I challenged myself to beyond my capabilities, which was foolish. But I always kept trying.

Please don't let the major NETS confuse you. It just means CS(+?) in my case.

**For your reference**

- [NETS program requirement](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/long/nets-curriculum)
- My transcipt trackrecord aligns well with both programs.

## Confessions
### Why is my graduate GPA only <sub><sup>3.2</sup></sub> when I graduated <sub><sup>magna cum laude</sup></sub> as an undergrad?
<sub><sup>This is really a false argument, I didn't do well, or as well as I hoped to do, as an undergrad. At the beginning I wished to be a machine learning engineer but it didn't work out.
I had many disillusioning moments in college. Life can be a paradox. I realized that my preconceived career in machine learning aren’t the best for me. I found my interest in linux through painstakingly installing systems at my first job. 
I had to face my lack of personal drive, reconcile my relationship with my family far far away, and accept my hard-earned victories are indeed mine. Fight the imposter’s syndrome. I deserve to be among these amazing people, for I can do amazing work too.
But the most severe challenging was then. March 2020, first month of Covid-19, I felt, almost for no reason, depressed. I had severe hyperthyroidism back then and I didn’t seek treatment. My hands were shaking horribly, I lost around 26 pounds in a month. Went from the peak of my weight to the all-time low since high school.
Like MJ, Winnie Harlow, I had vitiligo. It was the onset stage and my skin was losing pigments. I had disillusioning moments, I’m not good at Security games and Cryptography. I never felt a stronger lack of drive everyday. At the end of semester, I had a D in Security. 
If you don’t have a drive to live, you don’t mind death. But I don’t think that’s how I really felt. I tried religion, made new friends who are also reaching out to divinity for curing their real depression. I was certain then I’m not really depressed. I tried therapy, talking to a listening, caring person helped. 
My girlfriend moved in with me. Slowly but surely, I have finally gotten over the worse period of my young adult life. 
I got treated for hyperthyroidism in May 2021, after I regained confidence. Confidence that was rebuilt slowly by having a job I’m passionate about, exercise, losing weight and having hope. I was a coincidence that they discovered my hyperthyroidism, I was treated for a lump under my skin. 
Turns out, overactive thyroid leads to depression and short-tempers. Maybe I wasn’t who I thought I was. Ha, who knew! 
All of this inflictions are caused by my immune system, which is going bananas in my body, attacking my skin and glands.  But with treatments, exercise and a hopeful attitude, I don’t think anything can stop me. Everyone has their struggles, I believe. Mine is nothing special. But I believe that mine lead to my personal growth.
So yeah, that's why my graduate GPA is what it is. I don't know what this story is trying to tell.</sup></sub>

TL,DR: I had an unfortunate, regretable, devastating D grade, in computer security when my life was at its worst. But I believe it did't change who I am.

### My inspirations
1. My dearest friends and family. Isaac, my friend and mentor from DSL. Prof. Boon Thau Loo. My friends from grace covenant church. And all people that showed incredible kindness in my life.
2. Robert Martin (Uncle bob) on clean code: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&list=PLdpsE-GEhYVn_81kDPo1mwE73UgYCeMLu)
3. Our intro to algorithms (CIS 160/121) professor, our shepard, counselor to our Freshman sweat and tears. Prof. Rajiv Ghandhi's speech: [TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kao_IZUCKgg). I still remember the day that he gave the speech on last day of CIS 160, I remember that we are not special, but we pride ourselves on what we've built.
4. Book by our wise and lovely professor, Prof Jean Galier. [Linear Algebra and Optimization with Applications to Machine Learning](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/gbooks/linalg.html)
5. The brilliant inspirers that are [Prof. Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/) and [Prof. Stephanie Weirch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/). ([Article](https://csweb.rice.edu/news/stephanie-weirich-passion-programming-languages)). Functional programming. Ocaml. I loved the wisdoms embedded in programming languages and I shall perfect my craft with the best programming practice. For my final semester, I will take advanced programming, learn Haskell and functional programming to the best of my capabilities.
